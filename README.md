# Port Scanning Using Python Sockets

Network scanning for open ports is the focus of this project, designed as a Python-based port scanning tool through the use of Python’s
It determines the host reachable on the network by probing a set of preselected TCP ports,
without the use of ICMP (ping).

# Features
- Net scanning and solo-host scanning (CIDR supported)
- TCP port scanning using Python socket
- Allow users to define their port range
- ICMP (ping) not used

Usage python scanner.py
